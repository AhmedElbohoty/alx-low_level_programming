'''Returns the perimeter of the island described in grid'''


def island_perimeter(grid):
    '''Return the perimiter of an island.

    Notes:
        grid is a list of list of integers:
        0 represents a water zone
        1 represents a land zone
        One cell is a square with side length 1
        Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
        Grid is rectangular, width and height donâ€™t exceed 100.
        Grid is completely surrounded by water,
            and there is one island (or nothing).

    Args:
        grid (list): A list of list of integers.

    Returns:
        The perimeter of the island defined in grid.
